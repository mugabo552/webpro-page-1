                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>Kigali, the capital city of Rwanda, was established in 1907 by German colonial authorities. It became a key administrative center under Belgian rule after World War I. In 1962, when Rwanda gained independence, Kigali was chosen as the national capital due to its central location.</p>
                <p>The city has since grown rapidly and played a major role during the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi. Today, Kigali is known for its cleanliness, safety, and fast development, serving as Rwanda’s economic and political hub.</p>
